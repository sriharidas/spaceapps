The average amount of rainfall was in the range of 50000 to 55000, the graph represents the overall rainfall analysis each year.
                    In the existing system the authors have used the parameters based on the drainage system which may lead to some errors and some have connected to the Bluetooth so the message passing to the people becomes difficult. In this article the parameters are taken using the rainfall and predict the accurate rainfall at a place of the country and sending the alert information through the website dashboard stating the gates are being opened

            In recent times, India has faced many natural disasters. Due to the floods, it causes heavy damages to properties, wild life’s and huge loss of human lives. This problem can be overcome by a proper flood monitoring system integrated with Machine Learning and IoT. The proposed system can be used for better monitoring of water levels in dams. If the flood occurs, it easily communicates the information to the nearby people.  The implemented communication systems and transmission technologies are more efficient and can easily adapt to the background technologies. The proposed methodology has increased efficiency and accuracy for the prediction of floods, and even it gives good efficiency at critical conditions. Overall this proposed system would be advantageous for the people to get enough time to evacuate from the flood-prone areas before the flood occurs.
